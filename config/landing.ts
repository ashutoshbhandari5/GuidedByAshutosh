      "Ashutosh is my brother, he mentored me for long period of time and I just bought a laptop to learn coding. Now he guides me everyday. I'm 17 and I already feel confident about programming. Hoping for more lessons in the future. Once he asked me to work on his office code and it was a good experience, hope we do that oftenðŸ˜œ",

    review:
      "I met Ashutosh in Facebook group where I was stuck and asking for help. We ended up having a Zoom call, and he explained things in such a simple way, especially about procrastination and imposter syndrome. I used to feel so anxious about whether I was even good enough at coding. But he guided me every day, which helped me build better habits. Honestly, he was kinda strict at first, and I was like, 'Does he need to be this serious?' But it really helped me improve bit by bit.",
